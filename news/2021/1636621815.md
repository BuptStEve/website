## ES modules support

New minor versions of all icon components, including SVG Framework, have been published.

All packages were updated to export ES modules, build process has been changed to rely on ES modules. No more CommonJS! Bundling ES modules resulted in smaller bundle size for all icon components.

Loading icons from API has been re-written as well. New code is smaller and have full test coverage.
