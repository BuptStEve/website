```yaml
title: New website for icon sets
link: new-icon-sets-website
```

Icon sets section of website has been completely rewritten.

New version is based on Svelte version of [upcoming Iconify Icon Finder](https://github.com/iconify/icon-finder), with addition of server side rendering.

The same code base is shared with new [Iconify for Figma plug-in](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-figma) and [Iconify for Sketch plug-in](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-sketch) and can be used to create custom icon finder.
