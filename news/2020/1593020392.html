<p>Iconify version 1.0.7 has been released.</p>
<p>
	This version includes new bundle for SVG framework that does not include
	Iconify API support.
</p>
<p>
	To use Iconify SVG framework without Iconify API support, instead of
	including "iconify.min.js", include "iconify.without-api.min.js"
</p>
<p>
	Iconify SVG framework without Iconify API support works only work with icons
	that are bundled. That means you can use it offline, provided that you have
	added all icons you need in bundle.
