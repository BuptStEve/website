## Iconify version 1.0.7

Iconify version 1.0.7 has been released.

This version includes new bundle for SVG framework that does not include Iconify API support.

To use Iconify SVG framework without Iconify API support, instead of including `iconify.min.js`, include `iconify.without-api.min.js`.

Iconify SVG framework without Iconify API support works only work with icons that are bundled. That means you can use it offline, provided that you have added all icons you need in bundle.

Iconify 2.0, which is currently in development, will include similar bundle without API support.
