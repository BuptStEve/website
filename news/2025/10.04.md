## Iconify for Svelte update {#svelte-next}

[Iconify icon component for Svelte](/docs/icon-components/svelte/index.md) has been rewritten with Svelte 5 runes.

Previous version used Svelte 4 syntax.

Version 5 of component can be installed using `[npm]@next` tag:

```bash
npm install --save @iconify/svelte@next
```

While Svelte 5 supports old syntax, it is better to update component to make it future proof.

Additionally, the following changes are included in this update:

- Previously deprecated functions `[func]disableCache()` and `[func]enableCache()` have been removed.
- Previously deprecated function `[func]iconExists()` has been removed. Use `[func]iconLoaded()` instead (functionality is identical... more on that later in upcoming release notes).
