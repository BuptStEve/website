## Iconify for Vue update {#vue-next}

[Iconify icon component for Vue](/docs/icon-components/vue/index.md) has been rewritten with Vue's Composition API.

Previous version relied on Options API.

Version 5 of component can be installed using `[npm]@next` tag:

```bash
npm install --save @iconify/vue@next
```

If you prefer to use Options API, you can still use version 4 of Iconify icon component.

### Why Composition API?

Many Vue developers are moving away from Options API and now there is a new option
to remove Options API support from Vue bundle: `[str]__VUE_OPTIONS_API__`.

If there is a component that relies on Options API, it means new option cannot be used.

For Iconify icon component it does not make any difference which API to use,
there are no advantages in using either API, so switching to Composition API makes sense.

### Additional changes

Additionally, new version includes the following breaking changes:

- Functions `[func]enableStorage` and `[func]disableStorage` have been removed. They were deprecated in previous version.
- Removed wildcard export, which caused a Node warning when building a Nuxt app with Nuxt Icon on Windows.
