		>Around</a

	for sponsoring Iconify plugin for Figma!
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Working on Iconify is a full time job and servers cost money, while open
	source development does not pay, so sponsorships are very welcome. Thanks to
	Around for reaching out and offering to help out.
</p>

<p>
	You can contribute too! If you are using Iconify in your projects, please
	<a href="/sponsors/">consider supporting Iconify</a>.
