title: New major versions of icon components, utils, tools
link: update-2022
```

After several months of hard work, new major versions of many packages have been released:

-   [Iconify Icon web component](https://docs.iconify.design/iconify-icon/) version `[num]1.0.0`.
-   [SVG framework](https://docs.iconify.design/icon-components/svg-framework/) version `[num]3.0.0`.
-   New major versions of all [icon components](https://docs.iconify.design/icon-components/).
-   [Iconify Utils](https://docs.iconify.design/tools/utils/) version `[num]2.0.0`.
-   [Iconify Types](https://docs.iconify.design/types/) version `[num]2.0.0`.

Additionally, new minor version of [Iconify Tools](https://docs.iconify.design/tools/tools2/) has been published, which uses updated utils and types packages.

What's new:

-   In types, new properties for icon set were added: `[prop]lastModified` that shows last modification time, `[prop]tags` for icon set information that can be used to filter icon sets by tags instead of categories.
-   [Web component](https://docs.iconify.design/iconify-icon/) is finally stable. It is intended to replace old [SVG framework and framework specific components](https://docs.iconify.design/icon-components/). Unlike older icon components, web component works extremely well with server side rendering.
-   Alignment properties have been removed from all icon components. Alignment seemed like a good idea a while ago, but in reality it is not used and just bloats package for no reason. If you do use alignment, web component supports `[prop]preserveAspectRatio` property that is passed to `[tag]svg`.
-   [Render modes for icon components](https://docs.iconify.design/iconify-icon/modes.html), though not all components support it.
-   Many internal changes everywhere, designed to improve performance and reduce bundle size.
