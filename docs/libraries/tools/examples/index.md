# Iconify Tools code examples

## Short examples

Code samples are included in documentation for various functions. Some are short, some are longer.

The following code samples are short, yet complete enough to be usable:

- [importDirectory() documentation](../import/directory.md#examples) shows how to import all SVG files in a directory, clean them up, export as `[type]IconifyJSON`.
- [exportToDirectory() documentation](../export/directory.md#example) shows how to export icon set as single SVG files.
- [Import SVG files, clean them up, export as single SVG files](../export/svg.md).

## Long examples

Several examples for specific icon sets:

- [Convert Material Design Icons to Iconify JSON format](./import-mdi.md).
- [Convert FontAwesome Pro to Iconify JSON format](./import-fa-pro.md).
