# Iconify for Figma

With the Iconify plugin for Figma you can:

- Import icons. You can also drag and drop icons from plugin to Figma.
- Quickly replace selected icon.

It is completely free!
Unlike other plugins that offer many icons, but require payment to use SVG, Iconify always imports icons as SVG.
Iconify project is open source and offers only open source icon sets.

Plugin remembers the last page you have visited, making it easy to continue searching or browsing icons.

For visitors that have small monitors, the plugin offers compact mode.
Button to toggle compact mode is in the top right corner of the plugin window.
