Function `[func]toggleCharacter()` adds character to icon or removes it.

## Usage

- `[prop]iconName`, `[type]string`. Icon name.

## Character map

What is the purpose of characters map?

It is used to generate icon fonts. Each icon in an icon font has a character assigned to it. Even when using ligatures, ligatures point to a character, so character is needed.

## How to find all characters? {#chars}

You can get list of all assigned characters by using `[func]chars()` method.

If you want to know characters assigned to an icon, use code like this:

```ts
const item = iconSet.entries['some-icon'];
// Set<string>
console.log(item.chars);
```

It is safe to modify characters directly in `[func]entries` property.

## Example

```yaml
src: tools/tools2/icon-set/chars.ts
title: 'chars-example.ts'
```
