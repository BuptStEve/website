![How to get file ID in Figma](https://docs.iconify.design/assets/images/tools/figma_id.png)

In your clipboard you will have a link to Figma file, which looks like this:

```txt
https://www.figma.com/file/9lvc7JGhqpNnpF3OK9kjnG/Quill-Iconset-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1
```

File ID is between `[str]/file/` and next `[str]/`. In example above, file ID is `[str]9lvc7JGhqpNnpF3OK9kjnG`.

## Community files

Community files contain `[str]/community/` in file link:

```txt
https://www.figma.com/community/file/1034432054377533052/Quill-Iconset
```

It cannot be used to get file ID.

You need to get ID from actual file. If someone else published file to community, you need to clone it, then follow steps above to get file ID.
