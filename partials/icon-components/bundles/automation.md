Manually creating files with icon data is tedious. Good news, it is easy to automate.

You need to create a simple script that does the following:

1. Get icon data.
2. Wrap it in a necessary code (import `[func]addCollection` from component, wrap data in `[func]addCollection` calls).
3. Save it to a file, which is imported in your application.

See [examples](./examples/index.md) for scripts you can use.
