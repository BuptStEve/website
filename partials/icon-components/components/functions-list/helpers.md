- `[func]replaceIDs(html)`. Randomizes IDs in generated string. This should be used when rendering icon based on data returned by `[func]getIcon()` to make sure elements inside each icon have unique IDs.
- `[func]calculateSize()`. Calculates icon size. It is used to calculate `[attr]width` if only `[attr]height` is set and vice versa.
- `[func]buildIcon(icon, customisations?)`. Generates data used by icon component. This can be used if you prefer to generate `[tag]svg` yourself. Data includes attributes for `[tag]svg` and inner HTML.
