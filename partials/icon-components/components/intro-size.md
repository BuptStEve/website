By default, icon height is set to `[str]"1em"`, icon width is changed dynamically based on the icon's width to height ratio. This makes it easy to change icon size by changing `[attr]font-size` in the stylesheet, just like icon fonts.

There are several ways to change icon dimensions:

- Setting `[prop]font-size` in style (or `[prop]fontSize` if you are using inline style).
- Setting `[prop]width` and/or `[prop]height` property.

Values for `[prop]width` and `[prop]height` can be numbers or strings.

If you set only one dimension, another dimension will be calculated using the icon's width to height ratio. For example, if the icon size is 16 x 24, you set the height to 48, the width will be set to 32. Calculations work not only with numbers, but also with string values.
