SVG do not behave like other images. When you set wrong width/height ratio for other image formats, images get stretched. When you do that for SVG, bounding box is changed and image is aligned inside that bounding box.

In an example above, one icon is too wide and other icon is too tall. Browser will move icons to centre instead of stretching icon.
