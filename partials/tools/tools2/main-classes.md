```yaml
types:
  SVG: './svg/index.md'
  IconSet: './icon-set/index.md'
```

In Iconify Tools all functions for parsing icons work with 2 main classes:

- `[type]SVG` represents one icon. This class is used when icon's elements need to be manipulated.
- `[type]IconSet` represents an icon set with easy to use functions for managing icons.
