<div class="notice notice--no-icon">
	<p>
		There is a new replacement for SVG Framework:
		<a href="/docs/iconify-icon/index.md">Iconify Icon web component</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Please consider migrating to web component.</p>
    <p>SVG framework is no longer maintained. It works fine, so it is safe to keep it in an existing project, but should not be used in new projects.</p>
